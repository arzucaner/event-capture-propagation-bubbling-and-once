# Event Capture Propagation Bubbling and Once

---

## Challenge 30 is a programming challenge series created by Wes Bos. One of the projects in this challenge is focused on event capture, propagation, bubbling, and once.

Event capture and bubbling refer to the order in which events are handled by different elements in the HTML document. Event propagation refers to how events are passed from the outermost element to the innermost element in the DOM hierarchy.

In this project, participants are tasked with building a web page that demonstrates how these concepts work in practice. They may use JavaScript to attach event listeners to different elements on the page, and experiment with different options for event handling, such as capturing and bubbling. They may also use the "once" option to ensure that an event listener is only executed once, rather than multiple times.

Overall, the goal of this project is to deepen participants' understanding of how events work in the browser, and how they can be used to create more interactive and engaging web experiences.
